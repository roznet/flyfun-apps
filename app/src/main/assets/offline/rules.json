The process is the following, if there is an airspace planned in the airspase use plan the airspace management cell AMC will inform all of the services at least 30 minutes before the TRA is active, than if the TRA is active all of the civil aircraft must leave it. If there isa special operation such as pipeline check aerial working or agricultural working, the military control can grant individual clearance for them.",

Most regional controlled aerodromes can also accommodate Hungarian locally, but foreign traffic will always be handled in English. For international flights you should assume English only and use Hungarian only when both parties clearly speak it.",
